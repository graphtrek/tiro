## Flow diagrams

## Account information flow

![AIS flow diagram](https://enablebanking.com/docs/assets/img/ais-flow.6b45962b.svg "AIS flow diagram")

1. Application (i.e. API client) makes [GET /aspsps](#get-list-of-aspsps) request to obtain a list of available ASPSPs along with necessary meta data. Alternatively, the list of ASPSP can be displayed using the [ASPSP selection UI widget](https://enablebanking.com/docs/api/widgets/#aspsp-selection).
2. List of available ASPSPs is returned and displayed to a PSU.
3. The PSU selects desired ASPSP and an application makes [POST /auth](#start-user-authorization) request, specifying desired ASPSP and providing information about needed access rights.
4. Enable Banking starts authorisation in a desired ASPSP.
5. Enable Banking responds to the client with a redirect url to a Enable Banking page, where PSU needs to be redirected.
6. The PSU is redirected to the Enable Banking page.
7. After the PSU is redirected, Enable Banking does interactions with an ASPSP necessary to get authorised access to the PSU's account.
	These actions are ASPSP-specific and may be different depending of the authentication method (which may be specified at step 3).
8. The PSU is redirected to the callback URL provided by the application with additional parameters added in its query string.
9. If the authorisation went successfully then query string from step 8 will contain `code` parameter, which needs to be sent in [POST /sessions](#authorize-user-session) request.
10. The Enable Banking API will respond with created session\_id along with a list of accessible accounts and their details.
	Note that some of the information returned in that call is shown only once.
	After successfull response to [POST /sessions](#authorize-user-session) request the application can start making requests to Enable Banking API to fetch information about session, account balances and transactions.

Possible query parameters returned in the step 8 (parameters follow [The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749) ):

1. `code` — authorisation code.
2. `state` — same as state, provided in the step 3.
3. `error` — error code
4. `error_description` — human-readable error description

Possible error descriptions:

- `Denied data sharing consent` — user cancelled authentication before accepting data sharing consent (error code is `access_denied`)
- `Cancelled by user` — user cancelled authorisation of access to account information (error code is `access_denied`). There are also arbitrary error descriptions possible, which are coming from ASPSPs.

## Payment initiation flow

![PIS flow diagram](https://enablebanking.com/docs/assets/img/pis-flow.7c9dd4ed.svg "PIS flow diagram")

1. Application (i.e. API client) makes [GET /aspsps](#get-list-of-aspsps) request to obtain a list of available ASPSPs along with necessary meta data. Alternatively, the list of ASPSP can be displayed using the [ASPSP selection UI widget](https://enablebanking.com/docs/api/widgets/#aspsp-selection).
2. List of available ASPSPs is returned and displayed to a PSU.
3. The PSU selects desired ASPSP and the application makes [POST /payments](#create-payment) request, specifying a desired ASPSP, providing details for the payment to be initiated and other details such as callback URL, preferred authentication method, etc.
4. Enable Banking responds to the application with an ID assigned to the payment and a URL of the page, where PSU needs to be redirected.
5. The PSU is redirected to the Enable Banking page, where they shall review payment details and terms of the service.
6. After the PSU accepted term of service, Enable Banking does interactions with the ASPSP necessary to initiate the payment and complete its authorisation.
	These actions are ASPSP-specific and may be different depending of the authentication method (which may be specified at step 3).
7. The PSU is redirected to the callback URL provided by the application with additional parameters added in its query string.
	If the return URL does not contain the `error` GET parameter, the initiated payment should have been successfully authorised by the end user. The application can then retrieve the payment details to determine its status and additional information such as the debtor's name and account number.
	If the selected ASPSP payment type supports deferred submission for execution (`"deferred_submission_supported": true` is visible in the [GET /aspsps](#get-list-of-aspsps) response) and the payment was created with `"defer_submission": true`, the payment won't be automatically submitted for execution after it's authorised by the PSU. The application can call [GET /payments/{payment\_id}](#get-payment) to inspect the payment details (including the debtor's name and account number, where the ASPSP provides them) and then explicitly submit the payment for execution by calling [POST /payments/{payment\_id}/submit](#submit-payment). If the submit call is not made, the payment will remain unexecuted.
	If a [webhook](https://enablebanking.com/docs/api/webhooks/) URL was provided when the application created the payment, the [payment status will be retrieved in the background](https://enablebanking.com/docs/api/webhooks/#payment-status-webhook), and the webhook will be triggered whenever the payment status changes.

Possible query parameters returned in the step 7:

1. `state` — same as state, provided in the step 3.
2. `error` — error code
3. `error_description` — human-readable error description

Possible error descriptions:

- `Cancelled by user` — user cancelled authorisation of the payment (error code is `access_denied`). There are also arbitrary error descriptions possible, which are coming from ASPSPs.

## Authentication

In order to get access to this API you need to:

- Generate a private RSA key and a self-signed certificate;
- Upload the certificate to enablebanking.com and get application ID;
- Construct JWT with the data described below and signed with your private key;
- Send the JWT in the Authorization header.

## Private key and certificate generation

> Generating private RSA key

```bash
openssl genrsa -out private.key 4096
```

OpenSSL CLI can be used for generation of a private key and self-signed certificate.

Make sure you keep the private key in secret (e.g. don't expose it to client, share with anyone nor embed into mobile or other apps intalled to user devices).

> Generating self-signed certificate

```bash
openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -key private.key -out public.crt -subj "/C=FI/ST=Uusima/L=Helsinki/O=ExampleOrganisation/CN=www.bigorg.com"
```

You should replace values under `-subj` with appropriate values.

Alternatively you can use the private key generated in your browser [when registering a new application](#certificate-upload-and-application-registration). Just choose **Generate in the browser (using SubtleCrypto) and export private key** option when registering an application, and the private key will be exported after the application has been registered (the corresponding certificate will be used for the app registration).

## Certificate upload and application registration

To register a new application you need to have an account on the [Enable Banking Control Panel](https://enablebanking.com/cp) . You can create one by visiting [https://enablebanking.com/sign-in/](https://enablebanking.com/sign-in/) and entering your email address (a one-time authentication link will be sent to your email address).

In [the app registration form](https://enablebanking.com/cp/applications) you will be asked to upload the public certificate that you created for the application being registered.

An application can be registered to either `PRODUCTION` (aka "live") or `SANDBOX` (aka "simulation") environment. Applications can not be transferred from the sandbox to the production environment and vice versa.

Applications registered into the sandbox environment are activated automatically. Applications registered to the production environment at first appear as pending and will be activated either after contractual formalities for the use of the API are cleared or after you [whitelist your own accounts](https://enablebanking.com/docs/api/linked-accounts/). For more information please contact us at [info@enablebanking.com](mailto:info@enablebanking.com).

### Application registration API

You can also register an application sending POST request containing JSON with the application details and public certificate to `https://enablebanking.com/api/applications` endpoint.

The JSON body for the endpoint is to include the following fields:

- "certificate": Content of the certificate or public key of the application (always required)
- "environment": Environment (`SANDBOX` or `PRODUCTION`) in which the application will operate (always required)
- "name": Name of the application being registered (always required)
- "redirect\_urls": List of allowed redirect URLs for the application (always required)
- "description": Description of the application being registered (required when the `environment` field is set to `PRODUCTION`)
- "gdpr\_email": Email address for data protection matters (required when the `environment` field is set to `PRODUCTION`)
- "privacy\_url": URL of the application's privacy policy (required when the `environment` field is set to `PRODUCTION`)
- "terms\_url": URL of the application's terms of service (required when the `environment` field is set to `PRODUCTION`)

> App registration example using curl

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-JWT-ON-ENABLEBANKING-COM" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"name\":\"My app\",\"certificate\":\"$(cat public.crt | tr '\n' '|' | sed 's/|/\\n/g')\",\"environment\":\"SANDBOX\",\"redirect_urls\":[\"https://example.org/\"]}" \
  https://enablebanking.com/api/applications
```

In response to the app registration request, you will receive an ID assigned to your application, which is to be used when [forming JTW token](#jwt-format-and-signature).

> Example response

```json
{
  "app_id": "cf589be3-3755-465b-a8df-a90a16a31403"
}
```

## JWT format and signature

> JWT example

```bash
eyJ0eXAiOiAiSldUIiwgImFsZyI6ICJSUzI1NiIsICJraWQiOiAiY2Y1ODliZTMtMzc1NS00NjViLWE4ZGYtYTkwYTE2YTMxNDAzIn0.eyJpc3MiOiAiZW5hYmxlYmFua2luZy5jb20iLCAiYXVkIjogImFwaS50aWxpc3kuY29tIiwgImlhdCI6IDE2MDE0NTY3NjgsICJleHAiOiAxNjAxNTQzMTY4fQ.daO3ENSYIA3ud7Ay7uGQ0xxqq9r4_WLcM5SbrN_6_fqsFZXFdoGQA5nKiyP8Ot4nWdYcZvaNWxEAOIodUFndOP8pjihF9-rMXuNGEjde1cq2WjYzKwiIeodUej8okDWdB--szcgurzGMd8RRMjqr951PWqnXS-PbrRsavDHp8l2q4YBjh2m80nRruKnQCAn0dtm4A5G9rZaEowo9z-c8HJU101jKddyOpHhl9UvxVrERzHtyO4LdidiP4rP1hmaVMWybSbcIMI_h30qjqWP21kYRH9ENITTttbf0uZIa8s74jKYxNIdiiDyRaq9WjoPolrHI_ZxcMjp8mmCKX-N-1w
```

You can read more about JWT here: https://jwt.io/introduction/

JWT header must contain following fields:

- "typ": "JWT" (always the same)
- "alg": "RS256" (always the same, only RS256 is supported)
- "kid": "<application\_id>" (application id obtained after certificate upload)

JWT body must contain following fields:

- "iss": "enablebanking.com" (always the same)
- "aud": "api.enablebanking.com" (always the same, formerly had to be "api.tilisy.com", which is now deprecated)
- "iat": 1601456603 (timestamp when the token is being created)
- "exp": 1601460262 (timestamp when the token expires)

Maximum allowed time-to-live for token is 86400 seconds (24 hours). Tokens created with longer TTL are not accepted by the API.

```

In order to authenticate your application, you need to provide JWT in the "Authorization" header of your request.

## User sessions

The following operations can be used to initiate and complete end-user authorization for access to account information. The other operations provide possibility to retrieve session status and other details and to close (delete) a session.

## Start user authorization

`POST /auth`

Start authorization by getting a redirect link and redirecting a PSU to that link

## Access

### Properties

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| accounts | \[[AccountIdentification](#accountidentification)\] | false | List of accounts access to which is requested. If not set behaviour depends on the   bank: some banks allow users to choose list of accessible accounts through their   access consent UI, while other may provide access to all accounts or just access to   the list of accounts. |
| balances | boolean | false | Request consent with balances access |
| transactions | boolean | false | Request consent with transactions access |
| valid\_until | string(date-time) | true | This parameter specifies the date and time until which the authorised session   remains valid. The value must be in the RFC3339 date-time format with a timezone   offset, e.g. `2025-12-01T12:00:00.000000+00:00`. The provided value cannot exceed   the date and time, calculated as "now" + `maximum_consent_validity` (provided in   seconds for each ASPSP in response to the GET /aspsps request). The provided value   is subject to adjustment to comply with the ASPSP's requirements. Specifically, if   the provided value is less than the minimum consent validity allowed by the ASPSP   (e.g., some ASPSPs require a minimum of 1 hour or 1 day), the consent validity will   be adjusted to meet these requirements. However, the session validity will remain   exactly as specified. This means that even if the consent remains valid on the   ASPSP's side, the session will expire based on the initially provided value. |

| postal\_address | [PostalAddress](#postaladdress) | false | Postal address of the account holder |
| uid | string(uuid) | false | Unique account identificator used for fetching account balances and transactions. It is valid only until the session to which the account belongs is in the AUTHORIZED status.

| identification\_hash | string | true | Primary account identification hash. It can be used for matching accounts between multiple sessions (even in case the sessions are authorized by different PSUs). |
| identification\_hashes | \[string\] | true | List of possible account identification hashes. Identification hash is based on the account number. Some accounts may have multiple account numbers (e.g. IBAN and BBAN). This field contains all possible hashes.

API:   This date can be used in the following cases:   \- the single requested execution date for a payment having several instructions. In this case, this field must be set at the payment level.   \- the requested execution date for a given instruction within a payment. In this case, this field must be set at each instruction level.   \- The first date of execution for a standing order.   When the payment cannot be processed at this date, the ASPSP is allowed to shift the applied execution date to the next possible execution date for non-standing orders.   For standing orders, the \[executionRule\] parameter helps to compute the execution date to be applied. |

For credit transfers may contain free text, reference number or both at the same time (in case Extended Remittance Information is supported). When it is known that remittance information contains a reference number (either based on ISO 11649 or a local scheme), the reference number is also available via the `referenceNumber` field of the `Transaction` data structure. |
| transaction\_id | string | false | Unique identifier of the payment transaction, which can be used for fetching details through the get payment transaction endpoint |
| transaction\_status | [PaymentStatus](#paymentstatus) | false | Status of the payment transaction |
